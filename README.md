## Overview

1. [Install prerequisites](#install-prerequisites)

    Before installing project make sure the following prerequisites have been met.

2. [Clone the project](#clone-the-project)

    We’ll download the code from its repository on GitHub.

3. [Configure Xdebug](#configure-xdebug) [`Optional`]

    We'll configure Xdebug for IDE PHPStorm.

4. [Run the application](#run-the-application)

    All will works well now.

## Install prerequisites

For now, this project has been mainly created for Unix `(Linux/MacOS)`. Perhaps it could work on Windows.

All requisites should be available for your distribution. The most important are :

* [Git](https://git-scm.com/downloads)
* [Docker](https://docs.docker.com/engine/installation/)
* [Docker Compose](https://docs.docker.com/compose/install/)

Check if `docker-compose` is already installed by entering the following command : 

```sh
which docker-compose
```

Check Docker Compose compatibility :

* [Compose file version 3 reference](https://docs.docker.com/compose/compose-file/)

The following is optional but makes life better :

```sh
which make
```

### Images to use

* Nginx
* Varnish
* Postgres
* Adminer

You should be careful when installing third party web servers such as MySQL or Nginx.

This project use the following ports :

| Server     | Port |
|------------|------|
| Postgres      | 5432 |
| Adminer | 2000 |
| Nginx      | 8080 |
| Varnish      | 8081 |
|  H2-Proxy (SSL) | 80 |

git clone git@github.com:woprrr/sf-api-4-skeleton-docker.git
```

Go to the project directory :

## Configure Xdebug

If you use another IDE than [PHPStorm](https://www.jetbrains.com/phpstorm/), go to the [remote debugging](https://xdebug.org/docs/remote) section of Xdebug documentation.

For a better integration of Docker to PHPStorm, use the [documentation](https://github.com/woprrr/symfony-4-skeleton-docker/blob/master/doc/phpstorm-macosx.md).

1. Edit docker-compose file `docker-compose.yml` edit/adjust the configuration as needed for `XDEBUG_CONFIG` AND `PHP_IDE_CONFIG` environment variables.

2. If needed add a server for PHP as explained @see [Add a debug server section](https://github.com/woprrr/symfony-4-skeleton-docker/blob/master/doc/phpstorm-macosx.md#add-a-debug-server).

## Run the application

1. Setup project environment variables :

    Setup your project by editing the `.env` file and customize all environement variables. By default the ENV file are in symfony folder `./symfony/.env`

2. Initialize/Install project dependencies :

    ```sh
    make docker-start
    ```

3. Open your favorite browser :

    * [http://localhost:8080](http://localhost:8080/ OR http://nginx.local-symfony.com) (Web Front).
    * [http://localhost:8081](http://localhost:8081/) (Web Front Varnished).
    * [https://localhost](https://localhost OR https://nginx.local-symfony.com) (Web Front HTTPS).
    * [http://localhost:2000](http://localhost:2000/) Adminer (username: symfony, password: symfony)

4. Stop and clear services :

    ```sh
    sudo docker-compose down -v
    ```

5. Stop and delete all traces of changes from skeleton :

    ```sh
    sudo make clean
    ```
    That delete all files to reset skeleton at his initial state.
